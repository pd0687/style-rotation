three scenarios:
	500 (large cap) versus 600 (small cap)
	500 growth versus 500 value
	600 growth versus 600 value

target: monthly return spread (e.g., monthly return of 500 minus monthly return of 600)

features:
	M2 (money supply)
	CPI (inflation)
	CFNAI (productivity)
	3M TBill
	spread bewteen 10Y and 3M
	spread between 20Y and 3M
	equity risk premium
	lag-1 monthly return spread

objective: formulate a model that predicts when to switch allocation
	potential models: logreg, SVM, DT, RF, NN
	ensemble model is possible

monthly data is available dating back to early 2000
